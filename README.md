# Introduction

SpawnBox is a game framework (not engine!) based on the pysdl2 library, and a similar wrapper named MandawEngineSDL by Mandaw2014, [which can be found on GitHub.](https://github.com/mandaw2014/MandawEngineSDL)

SpawnBox's github repository is [over here!](https://github.com/oneshotenjoyer/spawnbox)

There is also a [project generator!](https://github.com/oneshotenjoyer/spawnbox-project-generator)

P.S, the documentation's markdown files are hosted on [this Github project](https://github.com/oneshotenjoyer/spawnbox-docs). You can add documentation, fix mistakes I made, or just look at how Gitbook structures things.
